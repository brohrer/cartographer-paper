\subsection{Naive Cartographer code}
\label{subsec:code}

The Naive Cartographer Python package is hosted
\href{
https://codeberg.org/brohrer/cartographer
}{in a Codeberg repository}.

The README of the repo has instructions for installation and
examples of how to integrate it into your project.

\subsection{Versions}
\label{subsec:versions}

The \textbf{\href{
https://codeberg.org/brohrer/cartographer-paper/src/branch/main/cartographer.pdf}
{latest version}}
of this document and all the files needed to
render it are in \textbf{\href{
https://codeberg.org/brohrer/cartographer-paper}
{this Codeberg repository}}.

I don't expect this doc to ever be done. I'm always learning new things,
or thinking of a better way to explain something, or I do a new
piece of work I can't help myself from including. And there's always
one more bug.
Since it's a git repository, you are free to browse past commits to watch
the evolution, but I'll try to keep a running record of important updates
here.
